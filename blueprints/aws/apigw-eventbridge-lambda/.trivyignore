# .trivyignore
# Trivy ignore rules for Terraform security scanning
# Based on terraform-skill security-compliance patterns
#
# Format: <vulnerability-id> [# comment]
#
# Only add ignores with justification. Prefer fixing over ignoring.

# Example ignores (uncomment if needed with justification):

# AVD-AWS-0086: S3 bucket logging not enabled
# Justification: This is a dev environment, logging adds cost
# AVD-AWS-0086

# AVD-AWS-0089: S3 bucket versioning not enabled
# Justification: Short-lived data, versioning not required
# AVD-AWS-0089

# AVD-AWS-0132: SQS queue not using customer-managed KMS key
# Justification: Using SQS-managed encryption (SSE-SQS) is sufficient
# AVD-AWS-0132

# AVD-AWS-0052: EventBridge bus not using customer-managed KMS key
# Justification: EventBridge uses AWS-managed encryption by default
# AVD-AWS-0052
