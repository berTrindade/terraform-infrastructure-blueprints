# Tech Lead Code Review Standards

## Before Approving PRs Check:

1. Blueprint patterns followed (ephemeral passwords, IAM auth, security groups)
2. Official modules used (terraform-aws-modules, cloudposse)
3. Proper naming conventions (snake_case, no resource type in name)
4. All variables/outputs have descriptions
5. Remote state configured with locking
6. Provider versions pinned
7. Tags applied to all resources
8. No hardcoded values or secrets

## Automated Checks Required:

- terraform fmt
- terraform validate
- tflint
- terraform plan (in CI)

## Architecture Review:

- Blueprint selection justified
- Cost implications considered (NAT vs VPC endpoints)
- Security groups follow least-privilege
- Modules are reusable and single-purpose
