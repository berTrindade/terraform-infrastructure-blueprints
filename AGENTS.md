# Terraform Infrastructure Blueprints - AI Assistant Guide

Opinionated, standalone Infrastructure-as-Code blueprints for AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each blueprint is a complete, self-contained package you can copy and own - no dependencies, no vendor lock-in.

**Key principle**: Copy one blueprint folder and you have everything needed.

**Consultancy model**: ustwo builds for clients. When engagements end, clients own the code. Generated Terraform must be completely standalone with zero ustwo dependencies.
