# Blueprint Catalog Reference

The **Blueprint Catalog** is the single source of truth for blueprint metadata, decision trees, and cross-cloud equivalents.

**Location**: [docs/blueprints/catalog.md](../../../docs/blueprints/catalog.md)

Use it when:

- Selecting which blueprint to recommend (sync vs async, database type, auth, etc.)
- Checking priority rules (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Finding cross-cloud equivalents (AWS → Azure/GCP)
